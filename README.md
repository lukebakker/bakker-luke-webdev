# web-dev-template

My name is Luke Bakker, I am a third year undergraduate CS student. I just finished my first co-op at Harvard Medical
School. Past projects I have worked on include: The music editor assignment in OOD, a space invaders app in Objective-C,
and a Harkness table app for classrooms.

This repository is for the Summer II webdev class. More specifically for the cumulative project.
